# TMCG

The front end of this project was generated with Angular Javascript framework and I used angular services to manage the cart ie adding and removing products.
 Due to time constraints i could not complete the backend mangement dashboard of the project and the VISA Payments.

THe front end communicates with the backend by use of restful webservices 

The back end is developed using JAVA restfull webservices with JPA and hibernate.

the database is Postgres SQL
